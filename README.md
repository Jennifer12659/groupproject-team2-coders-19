# I noticed that the monster was moving a little slow. So according to the professor's suggestion I can set a button that can change the speed of the monster.
# The speed should be markedly different in at least 3 of the 5 values and should be stored as a number


#pseudocoding
# if press the botton once
#    speed up once
#if press the botton twice
#    speed up twice
#if press the botton third times
#     speed up twice
#if press the botton fourth times
#     back to normal
#if user enters an odd number, display 'Y'

#I can attest that creating a button in the game interface has been done. I tried to run it once and found that it can be displayed in the game interface but it is not particularly beautiful. But my if statements and the actual monster speed up are not doing very well and there is a lot of debugging that needs to be done. So I will comment them all out and verify them later.

# I noticed that the monster was moving a little slow. So according to the professor's suggestion I can set a button that can change the speed of the monster.
# The speed should be markedly different in at least 3 of the 5 values and should be stored as a number


#pseudocoding
# if press the botton once
#    speed up once
#if press the botton twice
#    speed up twice
#if press the botton third times
#     speed up twice
#if press the botton fourth times
#     back to normal
#if user enters an odd number, display 'Y'
